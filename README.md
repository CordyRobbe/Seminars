# Seminars

Here I will have an overview of what seminars (webinars, etc) I have watched/followed

I am really interested in the use of AI in warfare because warfare is alaways gonna be around and AI wll be used in it. I am really interested in how the people will react and how they will solve the ethical questions.

James Rogers made some really interesting points in my opinions showing how AI has been used and how it will most likely be used. As I tought AI in warfare is as good as ready but the ethical questions is whats holding them back.
